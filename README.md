# Project in R
In this repertory, you can find a project I made in R. The subject is the correlation between academic success and sport. Indeed, it is now well known that sport in very important for the well-being of our body as well as for our brain. 
Therefore, with a classmate, we decided to look and analyse if there was a link between good grades and sport.
For this project, we needed to do a a form and we had 102 responses.

## The variables:
We decided to analyse three types of data:
• 4 categorical variables: the gender of the student, if they subscribed to PSL Sport, if the student think that sport is accessible in Dauphine and if the practice of a sport influence grades.
• 1 discrete quantitative variable: How many times a week does the student practice a sport?
• 2 continuous quantitatives variables: the grades of the student and the number of hours he use to work
per week.

Here are graphs for each variable (the form was in French):
