# The correlation between academic success and sport using RStudio
In this repository, you will find a project I conducted in R, exploring the correlation between academic success and sports. It is well established that sports play a crucial role in both physical and mental well-being.

With a classmate, we decided to analyze whether there is a link between athletic activity and academic performance. To gather data, we designed a survey and received 102 responses.

## The variables:
We decided to analyse three types of data:
• 4 categorical variables: the gender of the student, if they subscribed to PSL Sport, if the student think that sport is accessible in Dauphine and if the practice of a sport influence grades.
• 1 discrete quantitative variable: How many times a week does the student practice a sport?
• 2 continuous quantitatives variables: the grades of the student and the number of hours he use to work
per week.

Here are graphs for each variable (the form was in French):

## Estimation and Confidence level:
Point estimation and confidence intervals are calculated for PSL sport membership at different confidence levels (90% and 95%).
The confidence intervals help determine how representative the survey results are for the larger student population.

## Conformity test:
A conformity test is conducted to analyze whether students, on average, engage in sports at a certain frequency per week.
Results indicate that students practice sports approximately twice a week.

## Comparison test:
A test is performed to compare the proportion of students with high grades among those who study more than 10 hours per week versus those who study less.
The results suggest that study time alone is not the only determinant of good grades, implying that sports may play a role.

## Chi-square test:
A chi-square test of independence is conducted to examine the relationship between sports practice and grades.
The test confirms that the two variables are dependent, meaning that there is a statistically significant link between sports practice and academic performance.

## Conclusion:
The study concludes that practicing sports is positively correlated with academic success. Students who engage in regular physical activity tend to have better grades. Additionally, survey results show that 62.75% of respondents believe that sports positively impact academic performance. The project reinforces the idea that sports should be seen not just as a leisure activity but as a beneficial practice for both mental and physical health, ultimately supporting academic achievement.
